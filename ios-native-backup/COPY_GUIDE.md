# Copywriting Guide

## Tone & Voice

**Calm, Supportive, Inclusive**

- Use warm, reassuring language
- Avoid jargon and medical terminology
- Be concise but clear
- Support parents without judgment
- Use inclusive language (avoid assumptions about family structure)

## Writing Principles

### 1. Clarity First
- Use simple, direct language
- Avoid abbreviations unless necessary
- Explain technical terms when used

### 2. Supportive Tone
- Acknowledge the challenges of parenting
- Use "you" to create connection
- Avoid guilt-inducing language

### 3. Action-Oriented
- Use active voice
- Clear call-to-action buttons
- Specific, actionable instructions

## Common Patterns

### Buttons
- **Primary Actions**: "Log Feed", "Start Sleep", "Save"
- **Secondary Actions**: "Cancel", "Skip", "Later"
- **Destructive Actions**: "Delete", "Remove" (always require confirmation)

### Empty States
- **Title**: Brief, descriptive (e.g., "No events logged today")
- **Message**: Helpful, encouraging (e.g., "Start logging events to see them here")
- **Action**: Optional, clear CTA if applicable

### Error Messages
- **Be Specific**: "Failed to save feed" not "Error occurred"
- **Be Helpful**: Suggest next steps when possible
- **Be Calm**: Avoid alarming language

### Success Messages
- **Brief**: "Feed saved" not "Your feed has been successfully saved"
- **Positive**: Use affirmative language

### Disclaimers
- **Medical**: Always include "This information is not medical advice"
- **AI**: Explain what data is used and why
- **Privacy**: Be transparent about data handling

## Standard Phrases

### Medical Disclaimers
- **Predictions**: "This information is not medical advice. Consult your healthcare provider for medical decisions."
- **Cry Insights**: "Cry analysis is for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice."

### AI Features
- **Data Sharing**: "Enable AI Data Sharing to use predictions. Your data helps improve predictions."
- **Local Processing**: "Predictions use on-device heuristics. No data is sent to external servers."

### Privacy
- **Export**: "Export your data as CSV or JSON. Files can be shared or saved."
- **Delete**: "This will permanently delete all data. This action cannot be undone."

## Examples

### Good ✅
- "Log Feed" (clear, action-oriented)
- "No events logged today" (helpful, not judgmental)
- "Failed to save feed. Please try again." (specific, actionable)

### Avoid ❌
- "Feed Entry" (unclear action)
- "You haven't logged anything" (judgmental)
- "Error" (too vague)

## Localization Notes

- Keep strings short for translation
- Avoid idioms and cultural references
- Use standard date/time formats
- Test with pseudo-localization
